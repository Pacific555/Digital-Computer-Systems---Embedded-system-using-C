## About the Project

### My Role & Contributions

- Designed the full system architecture (MCU + PC GUI)
- Implemented bare-metal firmware in C for MSP430
- Developed custom UART protocol and FSM controller
- Built flash-based file system with metadata management
- Implemented ISR-based communication and power modes
- Developed Python GUI for visualization and control
- Integrated sensors, servo, ADC, and timers

### Technical Highlights

- Bare-metal Embedded C
- MSP430 microcontroller
- Interrupt-driven design (ISR)
- Finite State Machine (FSM)
- UART protocol implementation
- ADC10 sampling
- Flash memory management
- Low Power Modes (LPM)
- Sensor fusion
- Real-time systems
- Hardware/Software integration

### Performance & Results

- UART communication stable at 115200 baud
- Scan resolution: 1° per step (180 points per sweep)
- Flash file system supports up to 10 files
- Design to reduced data transmission by ~40% using angle inference
